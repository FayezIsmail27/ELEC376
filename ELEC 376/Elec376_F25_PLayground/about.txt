In this task you will be creating a simple substitution cipher program.
This is quite an old method of sending secret messages (not very secure) but fun to implement!

The idea is that each letter of the alphabet gets replaced by another letter. 
For instance, every “b” gets replaced by “Z”. 

-	Write a program that ask the user to input a secret message
-	Encrypt the message using the substitution cipher
-	Decrypt the message back to its original form

For example, to encrypt, replace character at position n of the alphabet 
with character at position n in the key. 
You are given the alphabet and key in the starter code.
